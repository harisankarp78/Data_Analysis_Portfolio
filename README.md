<summary>What I learned from reading case studies</summary>
<br>
Analysing data is time consuming and need effort. Before blindly touching given data set it is really important to understand the problem really well. If x is your problem and you are finding a solution for y then I think we all are wasting time and effort. It is very important to put the effort in the right direction. So here is what I understand from reading a case study of 'yammer'- a communication platform for companies. I got this case study from mode analytics. Found it really helpful.

<summary>15/08/2022 - Analyze International Debt Statistics</summary>
<br>
Today I have done a sql project. I completed 'Analyze International Debt Statistics'. It was a project listed in Data camp which is a very good platform for learning data science and analytics. I have made a jupiter note book. I will update the same in the upcoming days with added insights and summary. In a nutshell the project contained 9 questions, given data put lights on the world debt percentage by each countries. I used mysql work bench for writing queries. Listed the same in a jupyter note book but the story telling part needs much more improvement. I will work on it.
